this was an unfished camera rig project i was playing around with in houdini, i never got around to finishing it because work got busy and i will be moving over to Maya soon

this camera v1 i tried to create a 3D representation of the viewport that also plotted the cameras wordspace position in relation to the characters, this was going to be cool, but it didnt work because i used nulls and geo which eventually caused the FPS to drop a bit. it also had an overlay of the frame number, FPS, camera world space coordinates and project name.

camera v2 was a more simple version that ran faster, no nulls where used, it had buttons to make crops, and you can quickly add expressions as an overlay that would show up etc.
